# Emoji-Memory-Game
Description:

This is a browser-based memory game that uses emoji cards. The player must flip two cards at a time to find matching pairs. The game will include three levels of difficulty, with each level increasing in challenge by having more cards and more complex arrangements.

Additional features will include:

A move counter to track the number of attempts.
A timer for each level to add a time-based challenge.
Feedback when a pair is correctly matched or mismatched.
A final score based on completed matches, moves, and time.

This game will help players improve memory and concentration while being interactive and visually appealing.
